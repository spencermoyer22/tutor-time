# Tutor Time

  ## Description
  Tutor time is a full-stack MERN application that allows tutors to create a profile about their teaching and students to find tutors that they want to learn from.
    
  ## Usage
Students and tutors have separate login and sign-up forms and requirements. When a student is signed in, they can search for tutors by subject. They can then contact the tutor with their provided information, which includes their email address, rate, and also any additional information in an about section. Tutors are able to create profiles and have their information searchable to students so that they can contact them.
    
  ## Installation
